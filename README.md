# DSEP Economics Workshop Notebook Demo

Jupyter notebook created for Project 1 of Harvard University's Economics 1152 course, titled Stories from the Atlas: Describing Data using Maps, Regressions, and Correlations. The intent is to showcase the power of Jupyter notebook-powered assignments in Economics classes, combining easy-to-read text with code, attachable figures and plots to create cohesive student work. Questions 3-6 from the project are covered.

This repository contains the dataset, ```atlas.dta``` and the notebook itself.
